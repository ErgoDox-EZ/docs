## Configuring your ErgoDox


### Installing a configuration

a.k.a. flashing the firmware

First, make sure:

* Your keyboard is plugged in
* You know what the "Teensy reset button" is ([the tiny hole in the upper right](tiny_reset_button.jpg)). Alternatively, you can use the "teensy" key if it's in your keymap.

Then:

1. Download and run the [Teensy Loader app](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html)
2. Press and release the Teensy reset button
3. Click the "Auto" button on the upper right hand side of the Teensy-Loader window
4. Drag and drop the '.hex' file onto the Teensy loader window.
5. Press and release the Teensy reset button

Notes:

* If this process fails in the "Auto" button stage, try dragging in a the [firmware.eep](firmware.eep) file (from this repository) and a .hex file, then pressing auto and restarting the process from the beginning.
* For a more detailed account, check out the [ergodox-firmware repository](https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware#load-firmware-onto-the-teensy)

### Keyboard configuration tools

- [keyboard-configurator from massdrop](https://keyboard-configurator.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox)
    - Works and looks good *check the comments on that page for information about special keys, like hold-key-for-layer and media keys*
    - Isn't open source. Doesn't provide all options.
- [Fusion](https://github.com/ErgoDox-EZ/fusion)
    - Open source. Work in progress. Will and be useable soon!

### Existing configurations

[Look at the list of existing configurations on the wiki](https://github.com/ErgoDox-EZ/docs/wiki/Existing-configurations)



### Write/update your own configuration (in c!)

This requires a little bit of familiarity with coding. [Check out the list of keys and their names in c](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/blob/master/tmk_core/doc/keycode.txt)

1. Go to [github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware) and read the Readme
2. Follow the instructions for [ergodox_ez configuration](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboard/ergodox_ez)
3. Create a repository to track your configuration and **[add it to the wiki](https://github.com/ErgoDox-EZ/docs/wiki/Existing-configurations)**
